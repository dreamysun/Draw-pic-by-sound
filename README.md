CONCEPT

 The work identifies and depicts real-time images captured by web cameras according to the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT)  frequency division of environmental sound. The vision drew simple and transparent dots. Colors and images are processed according to the real-time images. 
It mainly indicates the impacts of volume and frequency of environmental sound on real-time images. When people pay attention to their behaviors, they can be aware of changes in environment sound based on image changes. 

HOW IT WORKS

Firstly, open source of the minim base and music in the computer are tested. Then, sound identified by the computer is tested. Abnormality occurs in the images. Through debugging, it shows that the microphone of OSX system only has positive figures. So steps of drawing are adjusted to achieve successful test.
